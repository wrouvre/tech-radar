# Motivation

At [Ippon](https://fr.ippon.tech/), we maintain a [Practices Radar](https://ippontech.github.io/tech-radar/) 
based on Zalando one [public Tech Radar](http://zalando.github.io/tech-radar/) to help our engineering & staff teams
align on technology choices. It is based on the [pioneering work
by ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar).

This repository contains the code to generate the visualization:
[`radar.js`](/docs/radar.js) (based on [d3.js v4](https://d3js.org)).
Feel free to use and adapt it for your own purposes.

## Usage

1. Insert practice file into `practices` directory, composed by Quadrants & Entry definitions:

```js
const dataRadar = {
  // Quadrants (limited to 4)
  quadrants: [
      { name: "..." },
  ],

  // Rings : 0=ADOPT ; 1=TRIAL ; 2=ASSESS ; 3=HOLD

  // Entries
  entries: [
    {
      quadrant: 0, // quadrant reference [number]
      ring: 0, // ring reference [number]
      label: "Amazing tech", // entry name [text]
      active: true, // entry visible [bool]
      description: "Lorem ipsum <i>arcu</i> non dapibus <a href='https://blog.ippon.fr/'>blogus</a>.", // entry description modal [text/html]
      moved: 0, // entry evolution [-1/0/1]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

2. Include the practice definition into 'practices.js' file :

```js
const practices = [
    {
        name: "DataRadar",
        radar: dataRadar
    }
]
```

3. Add the practice file into index.html :

```html
  <script src="practices/data.js"></script>

```

## Local Development

1. install dependencies with yarn (or npm):

```
yarn 
```

2. start local dev server:

```
yarn start
```

3. your default browser should automatically open and show the url
 
```
http://localhost:3000/
```
