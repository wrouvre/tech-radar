      <h2>WHAT is the Ippon Radar?</h2>
      <p>
        The Ippon Radar is a list of technologies or solutions complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring
        assignment</em>. We use four rings with the following semantics:
      </p>
      <div class="card-container">

          <img src="img/shield-check.svg" class="card-img-top" alt="">
          <div class="card-body">
            <div class="card-title">ADOPT</div>
          Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large
          scale. Technologies with a usage culture in our production environment experience, low risk and recommended to
          be widely used.

          <div class="card-body">
            <div class="card-title">TRIAL</div>
          Technologies that we have seen work with success in project work to solve a
          real problem; first serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover limitations. TRIAL
          technologies are slightly more risky; some engineers in our organization walked this path and will share
          knowledge and experiences.

          <div class="card-body">
          <div class="card-title">ASSESS</div>
          Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add for us;
          technologies worth to invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact. ASSESS
          technologies have higher risks; they are often brand new and highly unproven in our organisation. You will
          find some engineers that have knowledge in the technology and promote it, you may even find teams that have
          started a prototyping effort.

          <div class="card-body">
            <div class="card-title">HOLD</div>
          Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies that
          we think are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for new projects,
          but usually can be continued for existing projects.

      <h2>WHY this Ippon Radar ?</h2>
      <p>
        The Radar is a tool to inspire and support Engineering teams at Ippon to pick the best technologies for
        new projects; it provides a platform to share knowledge and experience in technologies, to reflect on
        technology decisions and continuously evolve our technology landscape. Based on the <a
              href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">pioneering work of ThoughtWorks</a>, our <i>Not Only</i> Tech Radar sets out the
        changes in technologies that are interesting in software development &mdash; changes that we think our
        engineering teams and clients should pay attention to and use in their projects.
      </p>

      <h2>HOW do we maintain it?</h2>

      <p>
        The Radar is maintained by our <em>Principal Engineers</em> &mdash; who facilitate and drive the
        technology selection discussions at Ippon across the Engineering Community. Assignment of technologies to
        rings is the outcome of ring change proposals, which are discussed and voted on. The Radar is open for
        contribution for all Engineering teams at Ippon Technologies and depends on their active participation to share lessons
        learned, pitfalls, and contribute to good practices on using the technologies.<br />
