    <h3>WHAT is the Ippon Radar?</h3>
    <p>
      The Ippon Radar is a list of technologies, approaches or solutions complemented by an assessment result,
      called <em>ring assignment</em>. Our convictions drive us towards the inclusion of not only technologies to
      this tech radar, but also of methodologies, approaches and solutions, without which technologies would hardly
      show their full efficiency. We use four rings with the following semantics:
    </p>
    <div class="bottom">
      <div class="item">
        <p><strong>ADOPT</strong></p>
        Approaches we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, <u>also in large scale</u>.
        We have a strong usage culture in our production environment, low risk and can be recommended to be widely
        used <i>(if it fits to the context and the situation)</i>.
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <p><strong>TRIAL</strong></p>
        Approaches that we have seen work with success in project work to solve a
        real problem; first serious usage experiences that confirm benefits and can uncover limitations. TRIAL
        approaches are slightly more risky because <u>they are not massively adopted through our organization</u>;
        still, several engineers in our organization walked this path and will share knowledge and experiences.
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <p><strong>ASSESS</strong></p>
        Approaches that are promising and have clear potential value-add for us;
        and so worth investing some research and prototyping efforts in to understand their impact better. ASSESS
        approaches have higher risks; often brand new and highly unproven in our organisation. Some of our engineers
        have knowledge in the approach and promote it, and <u>most often some teams have started a prototyping effort</u>.
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <p><strong>HOLD</strong></p>
        <u>Approaches not recommended to be used for new projects.</u> We do not think they are (still) worth
        investing in. HOLD approaches should not be used for new projects, but usually can be continued for
        existing projects.

    <h3>WHY this Ippon Radar ?</h3>
    <p>
      The Radar is a tool to inspire and support Engineering teams at Ippon to pick the best technologies for
          new projects; it provides a platform to share knowledge and experience in technologies, to reflect on
          technology decisions and continuously evolve our technology landscape. Based on the <a
            href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">pioneering work of ThoughtWorks</a>, our <i>Not Only</i> Tech Radar sets out the
          changes in technologies that are interesting in software development &mdash; changes that we think our
          engineering teams and clients should pay attention to and use in their projects.
    </p>

    <h3>HOW do we maintain it?</h3>

    <p>
      The Radar is maintained by the <em>Principal Engineers</em> of our 6 Practices &mdash; who facilitate and drive the
      approaches selection discussions at Ippon across the Engineering Community. Assignment of approaches to
      rings is the outcome of ring change proposals, which are discussed and voted on. The Radar is open for
      contribution for all Engineering teams at Ippon Technologies and depends on their active participation to share lessons
      learnings, pitfalls, and contribute to good practices on using them.<br />
